# Masqueraded File Checker
## CIS442-Fall-2023-UMASSD Final Project
This Python script was created to check for masqueraded files within a specific folder. It looks at the file signature of a files and matches it based on the data saved within the program. The program displays any files that do not match the file signature to the user.

## History
This project was created as a requirement for the Fall 2023 semester by Preston Terceiro for CIS 442 at UMASS Dartmouth. 

## Usage
Please keep in mind that only the following file types are currently supported: JPEG, PNG, GIF, PDF, ZIP, TXT, MP3, DOCX, and PCAP. 

1. Locate the file path that you wish to check for Masqueraded files in, copy this directory.
2. Run the program and when prompted to provide the file path, paste the directory that you wish to look for.
3. Analyze the results.

## Troubleshooting
If you receive any errors when running the program, you most likely provided a file path that does not exist or is invalid.
